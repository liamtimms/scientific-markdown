# Scientific Markdown

Scripts and templates for writing a scientific paper in markdown formatting. Make sure you view the actual templates in "Raw" markdown, github does not handle the yaml header appropriately.

## Why?

### Current solutions

- LaTeX

  - Pros:
    - easily the best existing language for dealing with complex formatting and type setting
    - many journals provide templates for use with LaTeX
    - FOSS compilers and plain text source files
  - Cons:
    - often uncomfortable for collaborators outside of physics, math, and comp sci
    - difficult to parse as plain text while writing (verbose syntax)
    - not all journals accept LaTeX source files

- Microsoft Word

  - Pros:
    - very simple to get started in
    - everyone knows how to use it
    - journals always accept it
  - Cons:
    - type-setting nightmare (IMO)
    - proprietary
    - impossible to work with actual source files (`docx` is actually a `zip` archive of some really complex `XML` files)

### Markdown + Pandoc

Compiles to both MS Word and LaTeX from a single source file. You can choose the pros or cons of either based on your current need without having to deal with complex processing in either.

# Documentation I still need to add:
